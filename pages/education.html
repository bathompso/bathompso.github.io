<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I have an special interest in physics, astronomy and data science education. Although I currently don't teach any classes, I still like to prepare. Below is a list of the current "courses" available on the site. Feel free to check them out and see if you learn anything!</p>

        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title"><b>Software Engineering for the Practical Academic</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text text-justify">A computational physics class will usually teach you the basics of coding for academia, but there's much those classes overlook. Especially when looking to transition into industry, there are plenty of other basic software engineering techniques you should be aware of, and some can even be helpful in a research setting. Learn all about the computing concepts that academia overlooks.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title"><b>Machine Learning for the Practical Academic</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text text-justify">You always hear about "AI" and "Machine Learning," but what does that really mean? Putting aside the craze, learn how to utilize popular machine learning algorithms to solve practical problems in data science and academia.</p>
