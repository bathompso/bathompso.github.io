## Educational Resources

As an academic, I like the pass on some of the knowledge I've accumulated over the years, as well share some supplemental knowledge from my time in industry. Below are some of the various topics I can talk intelligently about.

*As the new version of my site is built, I will add more to these topics, and flesh out concepts as much as possible. If you notice something wrong with any of the content, or have a suggestion for an addition, feel free to [contact me](mailto:bathompso@gmail.com).*
