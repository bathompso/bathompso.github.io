## Properties of Binary Populations in Open Clusters
#### Fall 2010 - Now
  
It has long been known that binary stars have fundamental effects on stellar and cluster evolution. In order to understand these effects and quantify them, properties of binary systems within clusters must be accurately determined, such as masses. Getting mass determinations are difficult for unresolved binary systems, and this research will utilize a different technique to accurately determine masses of both stars in a binary. Of special importance is the ability to detect the numerous low-mass binary systems which have, so far, been out of reach for conventional radial velocity surveys.

Once the binaries in a cluster have been identified and their properties determined, many interesting projects will follow. Binaries have long-been known to cause the formation of non-standard stars, such as blue stragglers. Using this technique, the percentage of binaries within a cluster can been compared to the frequency of blue stragglers. This will test hypotheses on the formation of these stars. This technique will be applied to a variety of clusters over an age range of 350 MYr to 9 GYr. These clusters will serve as checks for numerical n-body simulations of cluster evolution in order to understand how binaries alter their evolution.

This project will be the topic of my Ph.D. dissertation.
