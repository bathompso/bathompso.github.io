    	<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction and Installation</h1>

<p>Modern science is more and more dealing with large datasets and simulation, both of which require being able to write computer programs. Being an astronomer, much of my observational data is coming from sky surveys that output vast datasets for me to comb through. Without programs to sort, combine, and analyze my data, <strong>I wouldn&#39;t get anything done!</strong> Outside of astronomy, many other scientific disciplines are beginning to understand physical phenomena using advanced computer modelling. Bio-sciences are chief among them in using computer models to study things which cannot always be directly observed. Building and understanding these models will also require programming knowledge. Now you see why this class is so important! </p>

<p>The theme of this class (at least in my mind), should be: <strong>if you are to be relevant in science in the future, you must be able to write computer programs</strong>.</p>

<p>Before you (and I) get started in this class, I want to lay out some of the basic ideas behind my teaching method. The most important thing that you must remember throughout the entire experience is <strong>I am not a computer scientist</strong>. Things that many computer scientists may see as fairly important will not be discussed here: efficient use of memory, error handling, race conditions, security issues, etc. This is because those projects that we will work on in this class, as well as most of the programs you will write for physics research, will not suffer from any of these issues. If you end up going on into another discipline (more aligned with computer science), please do look up these best practices, as they will be of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>My experience with programming has been mostly self-taught, and as such I have picked up my own programming style, which may not always align with programming best practices. Most of my methods are brute-force, often memory-intensive, ways of doing things, simply because they are the easiest to write and none of my programs so far have run into issues being written this way. As you progress in the class (or read outside sources), you may notice that my way of doing something is not the &quot;best&quot; way, and you may begin to code programs differently. <strong>This is a good thing</strong>. It means that (1) you are now competent enough in Python that you are beginning to create your own style of programming, and (2) you are a more considerate programmer than I am!</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of the course you understand the basics of computer programming (and maybe a bit more). Let&#39;s get started!</p>

<h2>1.1 Installation</h2>

<p>Before we can attempt to write Python programs, we first must install the software. Along with the Python compilers, we must also install additional modules. Modules are software packages that add functionality to Python, such as advanced plotting and mathematical functions. Below are instructions for installing python and the necessary modules for whatever operating system you are using.</p>

<h3>Mac Installation Routine</h3>

<p>As I am building this course while running on a Mac, this will be the most complete walkthrough, and therefore (possibly) the most complicated. First, we need to download and install the XCode copilers, located in the command line tools package.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/downloads">developer.apple.com/downloads</a></li>
<li>Log in via your Apple ID (the login for iCloud, iTunes and the App Store), or make one.</li>
<li>Find and download the correct <strong>Command Line Tools</strong> for your version of Mac OS X. For older operating systems, you may have to scroll back a few pages.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, run the package installer.</li>
</ol>

<p>After the command line tools package is installed, you may notice that you already have Python installed. Installing packages and running programs through this version of Python is not recommended however, as it is the system&#39;s base location. If something goes wrong in the future (package versions get out of sync, something gets deleted, etc.) there is no easy way to <em>nuke</em> the Python installation and start over. It is best to install a new, second version of Python that is easily removable if something goes haywire.</p>

<p>To get this version of python, we first install the best Mac package manager: homebrew. You do this by loading up a bash shell (the default if you&#39;ve never changed it, or by running <code>/bin/bash</code> from another shell), then envoking the command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">ruby -e <span class="s2">&quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once it is installed, make sure to run <code>brew doctor</code> to make sure there are no outstanding issues with your install that need to be addressed. On a clean install of Mac OS X (or one where you never messed with any command-line stuff), you shouldn&#39;t have any issues.</p>

<p>After making sure everything with the homebrew install is fine, you can install Python via the command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">brew install python
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once that install completes, close and re-open your Terminal window, and then check which version of Python you are running by typing <code>which python</code>. The answer should be <code>/usr/local/bin/python</code>. If it isn&#39;t, you may have to update your PATH environment variable by editing your login <code>.tcshrc</code> or <code>.bashrc</code> file to make sure <code>/usr/local/bin</code> comes before <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p>

<p>Now that the main Python language is installed, we need to get the modules that will allow us to do more advanced things. We do this by using the <code>pip</code> command. <code>pip</code> should already be installed with the Python distribution you installed (you can confirm by simply typing <code>pip</code> into a command line), but if not, you can get <code>pip</code> via the terminal command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">sudo easy_install pip
</code></pre></div>

<p>After you run this command, close and re-open your terminal window so that the paths can be updated. Once <code>pip</code> is installed, you can install the necessary modules:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install matplotlib
sudo pip install six
sudo pip install mako
sudo pip install pyopencl
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>numpy</code> is a python module that adds lots of advanced math functionality to Python: Multi-dimensional arrays, matrix math and advanced calculus routines are found here. <code>scipy</code> contains many scientifically useful routines. <code>matplotlib</code> is a graphics module that mimics much of the graphing functionality of matlab. <code>six</code> and <code>mako</code> are helper modules necessary for the final package, <code>pyopencl</code>, which allows for parallel GPU computing in Python.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Linux Installation Routine</h3>

<p>This method was tested on a Virtual Machine running Ubuntu 13.04, but should work in general for any type of Linux distribution.</p>

<p>By default, Python should already be installed. In Ubuntu, there is no way to install a 2nd version of Python, so we&#39;ll use the default location. First, you&#39;ll have to install the Python package installer, <code>pip</code>, via:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install python-pip
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, in order to build some of the necessary packages, install the python developer libraries:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install python-dev
</code></pre></div>

<p>After you run this, close and re-open your teminal so that the paths can be updated. Once <code>pip</code>and <code>python-dev</code> are installed, you can install the necessary modules:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install matplotlib
sudo pip install six
sudo pip install mako
sudo pip install pyopencl
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>numpy</code> is a python module that adds lots of advanced math functionality to Python: Multi-dimensional arrays, matrix math and advanced calculus routines are found here. <code>scipy</code> contains many scientifically useful routines. <code>matplotlib</code> is a graphics module that mimics much of the graphing functionality of matlab. <code>six</code> and <code>mako</code> are helper modules necessary for the final package, <code>pyopencl</code>, which allows for parallel GPU computing in Python.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Windows Installation Routine</h3>

<p>I do not use Windows on a regular (or even infrequent) basis. This method was tested on a Virtual Machine running Windows 8.1, and should work for all other versions of windows.</p>

<p>Because there is no UNIX underpinning for Windows, a manual install of Python and the supporting packages is near impossible. Instead, there is an all-in-one installer that will handle everything for us. Head to <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">continuum.io/downloads</a> and download the latest Anaconda Windows installer for your system (either 32 or 64 bit). Run the installer, and everything should be ready for you. You can run your Python programs in almost the exact same was as your UNIX counterparts: open Command Prompt, <code>cd</code> to the right directory, then run <code>python [name of program]</code> to run.</p>

<p>Other packages can be installed via <code>pip</code>, which is also installed by Anaconda, however I have not been able to test this on a package that will install.</p>
