    	<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction and Installation</h1>

<p>Modern science is more and more dealing with large datasets and simulation, both of which require being able to write computer programs. Being an astronomer, much of my observational data is coming from sky surveys that output vast datasets for me to comb through. Without programs to sort, combine, and analyze my data, <strong>I wouldn&#39;t get anything done!</strong> Outside of astronomy, many other scientific disciplines are beginning to understand physical phenomena using advanced computer modelling. Bio-sciences are chief among them in using computer models to study things which cannot always be directly observed. Building and understanding these models will also require programming knowledge. Now you see why this class is so important! </p>

<p>The theme of this class (at least in my mind), should be: <strong>if you are to be relevant in science in the future, you must be able to write computer programs</strong>.</p>

<p>Before you (and I) get started in this class, I want to lay out some of the basic ideas behind my teaching method. The most important thing that you must remember throughout the entire experience is <strong>I am not a computer scientist</strong>. Things that many computer scientists may see as fairly important will not be discussed here: efficient use of memory, error handling, race conditions, security issues, etc. This is because those projects that we will work on in this class, as well as most of the programs you will write for physics research, will not suffer from any of these issues. If you end up going on into another discipline (more aligned with computer science), please do look up these best practices, as they will be of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>My experience with programming has been mostly self-taught, and as such I have picked up my own programming style, which may not always align with programming best practices. Most of my methods are brute-force, often memory-intensive, ways of doing things, simply because they are the easiest to write and none of my programs so far have run into issues being written this way. As you progress in the class (or read outside sources), you may notice that my way of doing something is not the &quot;best&quot; way, and you may begin to code programs differently. <strong>This is a good thing</strong>. It means that (1) you are now competent enough in Python that you are beginning to create your own style of programming, and (2) you are a more considerate programmer than I am!</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of the course you understand the basics of computer programming (and maybe a bit more). Let&#39;s get started!</p>

<h2>1.1 Installation</h2>

<p>Before we can attempt to write Python programs, we first must install the software. Along with the Python compilers, we must also install additional modules. Modules are software packages that add functionality to Python, such as advanced plotting and mathematical functions. Below are instructions for installing python and the necessary modules regardless of what operating system you are using.</p>

<p>These install instructions were tested on OS X 10.9, Window 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.04, but should work in general for any related operating system.</p>

<h3>Mac Installation Pre-Step</h3>

<p>If you are installing things on a Mac, there is an additional first-step that must be undertaken before installing Python: we need to download and install the XCode copilers, located in the command line tools package.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/downloads">developer.apple.com/downloads</a></li>
<li>Log in via your Apple ID (the login for iCloud, iTunes and the App Store), or make one.</li>
<li>Find and download the correct <strong>Command Line Tools</strong> for your version of Mac OS X. For older operating systems, you may have to scroll back a few pages.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, run the package installer.</li>
</ol>

<p>After the command line tools package is installed, you may notice that you already have Python installed. Installing packages and running programs through this version of Python is not recommended however, as it is the system&#39;s base location. If something goes wrong in the future (package versions get out of sync, something gets deleted, etc.) there is no easy way to <em>nuke</em> the Python installation and start over. It is best to install a new, second version of Python that is easily removable if something goes haywire.</p>

<h3>Anaconda Install</h3>

<p>Continuum Analytics provides an all-in-one installer of Python and <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html">whole array of modules</a>, called Anaconda. </p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">continuum.io/downloads</a> and download the Anaconda installer for your operating system. If you&#39;re using a Mac, I recommend downloading the <em>bash</em> installer, not the GUI.</li>
<li>If on Windows, simply double-click the downloaded .exe to get started. For Mac and Linux, you&#39;ll have to open a Terminal window, and run the downloaded script: <code>sudo ./Anaconda____.sh</code> on Mac, or <code>sudo Anaconda____.sh</code> on Linux. </li>
<li>If you are running on a Mac or Linux machine, make sure to add the path to your Anaconda installation to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable by placing it in your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.tcshrc</code> file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you should have a working Python install through Anaconda. Opening a new Terminal window (on Mac or Linux), or a Command Prompt window (Windows) will give you access to the new Anaconda installation by typing <code>python</code>.</p>
