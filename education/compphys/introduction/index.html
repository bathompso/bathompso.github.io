    	<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction and Installation</h1>

<p>Modern science is more and more dealing with large datasets and simulation, both of which require being able to write computer programs. Being an astronomer, much of my observational data is coming from sky surveys that output vast datasets for me to comb through. Without programs to sort, combine, and analyze my data, <strong>I wouldn&#39;t get anything done!</strong> Outside of astronomy, many other scientific disciplines are beginning to understand physical phenomena using advanced computer modelling. Bio-sciences are chief among them in using computer models to study things which cannot always be directly observed. Building and understanding these models will also require programming knowledge. Now you see why this class is so important! </p>

<p>The theme of this class (at least in my mind), should be: <strong>if you are to be relevant in science in the future, you must be able to write computer programs</strong>.</p>

<p>Before you (and I) get started in this class, I want to lay out some of the basic ideas behind my teaching method. The most important thing that you must remember throughout the entire experience is <strong>I am not a computer scientist</strong>. Things that many computer scientists may see as fairly important will not be discussed here: efficient use of memory, error handling, race conditions, security issues, etc. This is because those projects that we will work on in this class, as well as most of the programs you will write for physics research, will not suffer from any of these issues. If you end up going on into another discipline (more aligned with computer science), please do look up these best practices, as they will be of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>My experience with programming has been mostly self-taught, and as such I have picked up my own programming style, which may not always align with programming best practices. Most of my methods are brute-force, often memory-intensive, ways of doing things, simply because they are the easiest to write and none of my programs so far have run into issues being written this way. As you progress in the class (or read outside sources), you may notice that my way of doing something is not the &quot;best&quot; way, and you may begin to code programs differently. <strong>This is a good thing</strong>. It means that (1) you are now competent enough in Python that you are beginning to create your own style of programming, and (2) you are a more considerate programmer than I am!</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of the course you understand the basics of computer programming (and maybe a bit more). Let&#39;s get started!</p>

<h2>1.1 Installation</h2>

<p>Before we can attempt to write Python programs, we first must install the software. Along with the Python compilers, we must also install additional modules. Modules are software packages that add functionality to Python, such as advanced plotting and mathematical functions. Before you begin any of the following chapters, it is assumed you have the following installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>GNU Compilers (C, C++, FORTRAN)</li>
<li>Python 2.x.x</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
</ul>

<p>The following will walk you through the installation process. While I work on Macs, and the most accurate procedure will be for a Mac, I will do my best to alert you to alternative install methods for other OSes (Windows or Linux).</p>

<h3>All-In-One Installers</h3>

<p>While you can learn something from doing a manual piece-wise install of Python and the associated packages, it is easier (and quicker) to simply install everything via a single package. There are two options for this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>: Available for Mac, Linux and Windows, this will install Python and the necessary packages for this class.</li>
<li><a href="http://scisoftosx.dyndns.org">SciSoft</a>: This package is more geared towards astronomy, not only installing Python, but also other astronomy-related software (IRAF, PyRAF, DS9). If you aren&#39;t in astronomy, this will most likely be overkill for you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Manual Install</h3>

<h4>Step 1: GNU Compilers</h4>

<p>Some of the software necessary is actually written in other programming languages, such as C or C++. In order for that software to be compiled and run on your machine, you must have the required compilers. For Macs, the process is quite easy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/downloads">developer.apple.com/downloads</a></li>
<li>Log in via your Apple ID (the login for iCloud, iTunes and the App Store), or make one.</li>
<li>Find and download the correct <strong>Command Line Tools</strong> for your version of Mac OS X. For older operating systems, you may have to scroll back a few pages.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, run the package installer.</li>
</ol>

<p>For Linux distributions, use the built-in repositories to find and download <strong>gcc</strong>. I don&#39;t use Windows so I can&#39;t confirm, but installing <a href="http://cygwin.com">cygwin</a> <em>should</em> install these GNU Compilers.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Python 2.x.x</h4>

<p>The easiest way to get Python installed (as well as many other popular command line packages) is via a package manager. My package manager of choice is <a href="http://brew.sh">homebrew</a>, which is installed easily using the command at the bottom of their homepage:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">ruby -e <span class="s2">&quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a bash script, so make sure that you switch to a bash shell if your login shell type is different. If you have no idea what any of that meant, then just copy the command to a terminal window and run it. Once it is installed, make sure to run <code>brew doctor</code> to make sure there are no outstanding issues with your install that need to be addressed. On a clean install of Mac OS X (or one where you never messed with any command-line stuff), you shouldn&#39;t have any issues.</p>

<p>After making sure everything with the homebrew install is fine, you can install Python via the command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">brew install python
</code></pre></div>

<p>For Linux distributions, you should be able to run a similar command via the built-in packages managers (apt-get or equivalent). Often, Linux distributions will have Python installed by default. For Windows, you&#39;ll probably have to go to <a href="http:www.python.org/download/">python.org</a> and download the latest version of Python 2. <em>Note: There is a version 3 of Python, but there are different syntaxes expected in both versions. To make sure you&#39;re compatible with this course, make sure to get Python 2.</em></p>

<h4>Step 3: Python Modules</h4>

<p>Now that the main Python language is installed, we need to get the modules that will allow us to do more advanced things. We do this by using the <code>pip</code> command. <code>pip</code> should already be installed with the Python distribution you installed (you can confirm by simply typing <code>pip</code> into a command line), but if not, you can get <code>pip</code> via the terminal command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">sudo easy_install pip
</code></pre></div>

<p>After you run this command, close and re-open your terminal window so that the paths can be updated. Once <code>pip</code> is installed, you can install the necessary modules.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="shell"><code class="bash">sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install matplotlib
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>numpy</code> is a python module that adds lots of advanced math functionality to Python. Multi-dimensional arrays, matrix math and advanced calculus routines are found here. <code>matplotlib</code> is a graphics module that mimics much of the graphing functionality of matlab.</p>

<p>Once the modules are installed, we are ready to get on to writing some basic programs.</p>
