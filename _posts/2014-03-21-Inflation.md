[Astronomers, using a small telescope in the South Pole have made an amazing discovery](http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/17/5518346/first-evidence-gravitational-waves-supports-big-bang-inflation). If this finding turns out to be real (via confirmation from another observatory), it may well be the most important astronomical breakthrough of this century. The detected signal not only would be, I believe, the first measurement of [gravitational waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave), but also a confirmation of [cosmic Inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology\)).

Inflation was mainly "invented" to solve several cosmological problems: the flatness of the Universe and the uniformity of the [CMB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background). It completely explained those, but it still was essentially a "made up" fix. If this confirmation is true, it would finally cement Inflation as a certified Theory, instead of a "thought experiment" solution to our cosmological observations.

Now that Inflation has been (supposedly) confirmed true, I hope we can do the same with the two existing cosmological "fudge factors": dark matter and dark energy. Now **that** would actually be the most important cosmological breakthrough of this century.
