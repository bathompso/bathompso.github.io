The [associated textbook](http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Emejn/computational-physics/) is a very thorough and complete way of learning how to code in Python, and I will not reproduce it here. If you have not done any programming before, I suggest reading through [Chapter 2 of the textbook](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/programming.pdf) before attempting this lesson.

The sections below are a somewhat-complete, but brief, overview of Python syntax and structure. If you've already done some programming in another language and want a handy guide on Python syntax for all the basics, this lesson will do the trick.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## [2.1 Basic Programming](basicprogramming/)

This section will describe the most basic programming functions: commenting, saving values to variables, importing modules, and basic I/O.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## [2.2 Lists and Arrays](listsandarrays/)

You will end up working with vectors and matrices often in physics programming. This section will show you how to work with lists of data, as well as N-Dimensional arrays.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## [2.3 Flow Control](flowcontrol/)

You'll learn how to break up the linear flow of your programs with IF/ELSE statements and loops in this section.
