[The first results from the Cosmic Microwave Background-mapping Planck space telescope have been released.][1] What&#8217;s new? There is more dark matter in the Universe than previously thought, and less dark energy. Regular matter (everything we can see and touch), still makes up a paltry 5% of all energy in the Universe. To think of how insignificant we are compared to astrophysical objects (galaxies, galaxy clusters, etc), it gets even more mind blowing to think that&#8217;s only 5% of everything out there. But that 5% makes all the pretty things in the Universe.

As for other scientific results, Planck scientists seems to have found odd trends in CMB temperature that shouldn&#8217;t be there. Coincidentally, these trends follow somewhat closely the path of the Sun, so there may be some weird systematic effect confounding the results. If there is truly non-uniformity, this could be a clue into the workings of physics around the time of the Big Bang.

Should be a fun ride.
