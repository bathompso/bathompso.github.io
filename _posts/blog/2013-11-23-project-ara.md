[Motorola is moving forward with their Project Ara modular cell phone initiative.](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133522/motorola-signs-project-ara-manufacturing-partner) While I don&#8217;t think the idea of a modular cell phone will ever take off, there are benefits in exploring the tech. Perhaps studying ways to modularize a cell phone will lead to improvements in antenna, battery or screen technology, which would benefit the smartphone market as a whole.

As a stockholder of 3D Systems (DDD), I&#8217;m happy to see them chasing new markets as well. While they are one of the major players in the 3D printing industry, they could open up a large new revenue stream if Project Ara smartphones ever get off the ground.

If they could also figure out a way to 3D print some of the components, that would be a future I&#8217;m interested in.
