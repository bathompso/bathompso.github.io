I for one completely support this tactic. As they put it eloquently in their [post on the decision](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments?src=SOC&dom=tw):

> A politically motivated, decades-long war on expertise has eroded the popular consensus on a wide variety of scientifically validated topics. Everything, from evolution to the origins of climate change, is mistakenly up for grabs again. Scientific certainty is just another thing for two people to &#8220;debate&#8221; on television. And because comments sections tend to be a grotesque reflection of the media culture surrounding them, the cynical work of undermining bedrock scientific doctrine is now being done beneath our own stories, within a website devoted to championing science.

Due to the easily-swayed minds of Americans, disagreements on science facts seem to perpetuate the belief that these results are up for debate.

Also, the next time I hear (or read) &#8220;well it&#8217;s only a theory&#8221; I&#8217;m going to throw them out a window. There&#8217;s a theory of gravity; let&#8217;s see you debate that one before you hit the ground.
